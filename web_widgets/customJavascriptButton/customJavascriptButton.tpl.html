<!-- The custom widget template is defined here
   - You can use standard HTML tags and AngularJS built-in directives, scope and interpolation system
   - Custom widget properties defined on the right can be used as variables in a templates with properties.newProperty
   - Functions exposed in the controller can be used with ctrl.newFunction()
   - You can use the 'environment' property injected in the scope when inside the Editor whiteboard. It allows to define a mockup
     of the Custom Widget to be displayed in the whiteboard only. By default the widget is represented by an auto-generated icon
     and its name (See the <span> below).
